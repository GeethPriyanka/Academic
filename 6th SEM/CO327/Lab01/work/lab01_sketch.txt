top  => show all current processes
ps -a  => select all the processes except both session leaders and processes not associated with the terminal
ps -x => view all processes owned by the current user
ps -u => Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.
ps -w => adjusting the window size

Process ID 1 is usually the init process primarily responsible for starting and shutting down the system (ps -eaf)








tty => terminal type

PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:
       D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
       R    running or runnable (on run queue)
       S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
       T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
       W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
       X    dead (should never be seen)
       Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
       <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
       N    low-priority (nice to other users)
       L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
       s    is a session leader
       l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
       +    is in the foreground process group.
